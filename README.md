# Continuing Care
Continuing Care enables individuals to gain more knowledge about their health and a convenient place to keep saved health information. Users can set up a personal account and search health conditions or view a page of all health conditions listed A to Z . Users will be able to view educational resources on each condition, add condition to personal profile and add/delete personalized comments to each condition. Users can also search for physicians nearby, add physician to profile for easy contact information and view location on map. Users can input their daily vitals to keep a record to bring to their physician. Additionally, all vitals will be viewable on a graph to observe a visual trend.
